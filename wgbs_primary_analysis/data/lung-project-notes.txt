aim- measuring turnover of airway epithelial cells & graft 
hyp - increasing airway damage --> increase in rejection ? 
show that can measure donoro derived cfDNA and DNA is epthelial cell derived 
_vars.csv -> imputed donor and recipent genomes for 2 subjects --> looked for sites with recipent is homo and donor is either hetero and homo other allele 
top sites between epithelium and other tissues, enrichment in number of reads for excess lung epithelium w/ high donor fraction 
4 samples. - 2 'far out' 1 with rection, 1 without, 2 other samples on one patient, collected immediately after transplant (2 days and 2 weeks) -- after 2 days high donor fraction, 10%, 
bar char with most likely site of origin for tissues
